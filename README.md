Welcome! I am very glad to have you here!
Serenity is a personal finance app that focuses on financial literacy.

ðŸ’µ I am a firm believer that personal finance is a life skill and ought to be taught to children in schools. We all know after the GFC of '08, how the lack of financial knowledge can have devastating consequences.
Together, we can help our loved ones to learn how to budget and plan for long-term financial goals.
So ask yourself, are you financially healthy? ðŸ’³
